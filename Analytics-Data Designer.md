## Introduction 
This course provides an overview of Data Designer, a powerful tool which can help you discover richer, more meaningful insights from your customer data. The following topics are included in this course:

- Overview of Data Designer
- Benefits of Using Data Designer
- Overview of How to Build a Dataset in Data Designer

Key uses of Data Designer
- Linking two unrelated data objects or even different application objects and applying powerful transformations
* Reducing the object and field level complexity of a data set by shortlisting the fields from all fields in objects to only the ones required by your use case
* Utilizing your refined data set across Gainsight in tools like report builder and rules engine
* Can be used to join data from different applications such as Salesforce, Gainsight and an Amazon S3 Bucket.

### Sample Use Cases 
- Tracking accounts without a Timeline Entry (demonstrated later in this course)
- View Timeline entries associated with a specific CTA
- Track open Renewal Playbooks and whether the status of the next task is overdue
- Calculate percentage of at-risk customers

Data Designer allows the merging of data from different objects into flat data sets that can be reported on. This extends the ability of reports which, on their own, are limited to data from single objects. [[Analytics- Reports & Dashboards 1]]

Three steps to building a data set: 
1. **Dataset preparation** Construct joins via a drag and drop interface.  
2. **Explore the dataset** Visualize the data to understand the population and determine if additional updates need to be made during step 1. 
3. **Configure the dataspace** Once satisfied with the data set, configuration saves it under the MDA and makes it available for use in reporting/dashboards, the rules engine and journey orchestrator.
