## Qualifications

The Gainsight Associate Admin Certificate is for new Admins who are  just starting their Gainsight Administration journey. It's also open to  non-customers who are serious about learning Gainsight Administration  and are ready to take the first step. The exam is designed to assess  whether you have completed the introductory training and understood the  basic concepts behind Gainsight CS application functionality.

Candidates should successfully complete the self-paced Gainsight  Admin courses for NXT or possess the equivalent experience and knowledge  prior to taking the exam. If you fail the exam once, you can sign up  for a retake after 24 hours. If you fail on the second attempt, you can  sign up for a final retake after one week. We recommend you use this  time to review the course content.

Preparation

We strongly recommend completing the following courses before taking  the exam. We also recommend hands-on practice with Gainsight. If you  don't already have access to a sandbox or production instance of  Gainsight, and you're serious about learning Gainsight administration,  you may request access to a training environment by emailing [training@gainsight.com.](mailto:training@gainsight.com)
