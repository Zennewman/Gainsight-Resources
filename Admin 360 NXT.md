## Course Material 
The Customer 360 sits on the company page layout. It essentially serves as a dashboard for the customer with a variety of customizable information displayed relating to account metrics. 

There are several standard widgets that can be added. There is also a lot of room for customization on the C360. It's intended to be a quick snapshot of important information for the customer. 

**Administration -> Customer Data -> Company -> 360 Layouts**

Up to 50 different C360 layouts can be customized for use by different users/customers. 

Global Sections are modular components that can be created and saved for use across different page layouts. They can be found in the global sections panel under Administration -> Customer Data -> Company -> 360 Layouts -> Global Sections 

### Best Practices 
* C360 is intended to help CSMs prepare for customer calls 
* Don't overcrowd the page (this will clutter out the most important information and impact load times)
* Order sections based on level of importance/ how likely the CSM is to need the information 

### Other Sections to Consider
- **Attributes** show additional account fields
- **Contacts** to highlight key points of contact within the account  
- **Opportunities** to provide visibility into the pipeline
- **Cases** to see what issues have been raised and are still outstanding
