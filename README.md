## TLDR 

### Analytics 
* **Navigation** 
	* Settings -> Analytics -> Report Builder
	* Settings -> Analytics -> Dashboard Builder
	* Settings -> Analytics -> Data Designer 
* Reports can only pull data from one object at a time unless a data set containing information from multiple objects has been created with Data Designer first. 
* Data Designer takes information from multiple tables either in Gainsight or in external tables from the MDA and flattens them into a data set that can be saved for use in the Rules Engine, Journey Orchestrator and reports.
* Dashboards can combine widgets visualizing data from multiple reports as well as widgets containing iframes, photos and rich text.
