----- 
Gainsight Home is a one stop workspace for CSMs. Gainsight Home displays widgets from multiple  applications in Gainsight for users to have quick access to the right information and tools. As an admin, you can configure the widgets and reports that matter most for your team, and help your CSMs improve their efficiency with their day-to-day tasks. 

CSMs can see Gainsight Home only when the admin configures and publishes it. Configuration is available under Administration > Gainsight Home. There are two ways to configure Gainsight Home:  

-   Gainsight Recommended 
-   Custom

Multiple Homepage layouts can be customized for different use cases and made available to individual users, groups of users, or all users for them to toggle between
